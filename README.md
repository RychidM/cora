# RM Memory Vault — Claude Plugin

A Claude plugin that turns RM's Obsidian-based memory vault into a
first-class agent capability. Log ideas, promote reviewed entries, sync
agent files to project repos, search the vault, and manage projects —
all from chat with any Claude agent (Claude Code, Claude desktop).

---

## What this plugin does

The vault is a structured Obsidian repository that holds RM's projects,
ideas, identity, and agent write-back log. Without this plugin, every
operation on the vault is manual: copy entries, move them between files,
update indexes, regenerate per-repo agent context, archive old entries.

With this plugin installed, any Claude agent can do all of those things
directly. Every action that touches the vault has a skill behind it, and
each skill has a slash command for explicit invocation.

---

## Installation

### From the Claude marketplace (when published)

```
/plugin install rm-memory-vault
```

### From this repository (local dev)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RychidM/rm-memory-vault-plugin.git
cd rm-memory-vault-plugin

# Claude Code
ln -s "$(pwd)" ~/.claude/plugins/rm-memory-vault

# Claude desktop
# (Drop the folder into the Claude desktop plugins directory or use
# Settings → Plugins → Install from folder)
```

---

## Configuration

The plugin needs to know where your vault lives. Set:

```bash
export AGENT_MEMORY_VAULT="$HOME/obsidian-memory-vault"
```

On macOS with the vault in iCloud:

```bash
export AGENT_MEMORY_VAULT="$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/<your-vault>"
```

**The env var must be visible to the agent's process, not just your
terminal.** A skill reads it by running `echo "$AGENT_MEMORY_VAULT"`, so the
variable has to be exported in the environment that launched Claude — put the
`export` in your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`) and start Claude Code from that
shell. Setting it in an unrelated terminal after Claude is already running has
no effect.

**Claude desktop has no shell**, so the env var can't be read there. Add the
vault to the Filesystem MCP's allowed directories instead — the plugin then
locates it via `list_allowed_directories`.

If neither resolves, the plugin falls back to `~/obsidian-memory-vault`, and
if that doesn't exist it stops and asks rather than writing to a guessed path.

| `vault-status` | `/vault-status` | Show projects, open issues, pending log counts |
| `vault-project-init` | `/vault-init` | Create a new project or module from the template |
| `vault-project-sync` | `/vault-sync` | Write fresh `CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md`/etc. to a repo |
| `vault-find` | `/vault-find` | Search across projects, ideas, brand, log |
| `vault-log-archive` | `/vault-archive` | Move promoted/discarded entries into monthly archives |
| `vault-review` | `/vault-review` | Approve/discard/defer pending entries from chat |

You don't have to use the slash commands — skills auto-trigger on
matching phrases ("log this", "promote approved", "search vault for X").

### Operation coverage

Every vault surface now has create / read / update / lifecycle coverage:

| Surface | Create | Read | Update | Lifecycle / remove |
|---------|--------|------|--------|--------------------|
| Pending log | `vault-logger` | `vault-status`, `vault-find`, `vault-read` | `vault-review`, `vault-promoter` | `vault-log-archive` |
| Projects | `vault-project-init` | `vault-status`, `vault-read` | `vault-edit`, `vault-promoter`, `vault-move` (rename/relocate) | `vault-project-status` (incl. archive) |
| Ideas | `vault-logger` → `vault-promoter` | `vault-find`, `vault-read` | `vault-edit` | `vault-idea-status` |
| Issues | `vault-logger` → `vault-promoter` | `vault-find`, `vault-read` | `vault-edit`, `vault-promoter` (resolve) | — |
| Brand | — | `vault-find`, `vault-read` | `vault-edit` | — |
| Repo agent files | `vault-project-sync` | — | `vault-project-sync` | — |

## Typical workflow

### The core loop — log → review → promote → archive

1. **During work**, in Claude Code or Claude desktop, say:
   > "Log this decision to my vault."

   The `vault-logger` skill writes a `[PENDING]` entry to
   `_logs/PENDING_REVIEW.md`.

2. **Later**, review each `[PENDING]` entry. Either open the vault in
   Obsidian and change the status field, or do it from chat:
   > "Approve the agentwatch entries, discard the rest."

   The `vault-review` skill applies your decision in place.

3. **Back in Claude**, say:
   > "Promote approved entries."

   The `vault-promoter` skill moves each `[APPROVED]` entry to its
   destination file (issues to `ISSUES.md`, decisions to `OVERVIEW.md`,
   ideas to `ideas/{domain}.md`, etc.) and marks them `[PROMOTED]`.

4. **Periodically**, say:
   > "Archive the log."

   The `vault-log-archive` skill moves promoted/discarded entries into
   `_logs/archive/YYYY-MM.md`, keeping the review log focused.

### Looking things up

- > "What did I note about pairing flow?" → `vault-find` returns ranked
  snippets across projects, ideas, brand, and the log.
- > "Show me the full agentwatch overview." → `vault-read` returns the
  complete file or entry, not just snippets.
- > "Where do things stand?" → `vault-status` summarises projects, open
  issues, and pending-log counts.

### Editing what already exists

When something in the vault is wrong rather than new, skip the log:

> "Fix the typo in the agentwatch style guide."

The `vault-edit` skill makes a surgical in-place edit, confirms a
before → after first, and records the change as a `[PROMOTED]` context
entry so it stays traceable. (New knowledge still goes through
`vault-logger` so it gets reviewed.)

### Moving things through their lifecycle

- > "The offline-sync idea is shipped." → `vault-idea-status` advances the
  idea and moves it to the shipped/archived section.
- > "Mark agentwatch active." / "Archive the foo project." →
  `vault-project-status` updates the status across `PROGRESS.md`,
  `_INDEX.md`, and `AGENTS.md`; archiving relocates the folder to
  `projects/_archive/`.

### Setting up and reshaping projects

- > "Create a new project called bar." → `vault-project-init` scaffolds
  the folder from the template and registers it.
- > "Sync agent files for this repo." → `vault-project-sync` writes fresh
  `CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md`/etc. into the repo.
- > "Rename agentwatch to agentscope." / "Move foo under bar." →
  `vault-move` relocates the folder and repoints every reference and
  `[[wikilink]]`. Re-run the sync afterward — agent files go stale on a
  move.

```
obsidian-memory-vault/
├── AGENTS.md                 ← Global agent entry point
├── _logs/
│   ├── PENDING_REVIEW.md     ← Agent write-back log
│   └── archive/              ← Monthly archives
├── projects/
│   ├── _INDEX.md
│   ├── _TEMPLATE/            ← Template files used by /vault-init
│   ├── _archive/            ← Retired projects (moved by /vault-project-status)

└── ideas/
    ├── technical.md

    └── business.md
```

If you don't have this structure yet, the
[rm-memory-vault](https://github.com/RychidM/rm-memory-vault) starter sets it
up.

## Status semantics

Entries in `_logs/PENDING_REVIEW.md` carry a status field:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[PENDING]` | Default. Not yet reviewed. |
| `[APPROVED]` | RM has approved. Ready for promotion. |
| `[PROMOTED]` | Agent has moved it to its destination. |
| `[DISCARDED]` | RM said no. Agents ignore. |
| `[DEFER]` | Revisit later. Agents ignore. |

`vault-promoter` only touches `[APPROVED]` entries. It never deletes —
archival is a separate step (`vault-log-archive`).

---

## Design notes

- **Read-only skills** (`vault-status`, `vault-find`, `vault-read`) never
  write to the vault.
- **Write skills** are append-only or transform-in-place — none ever
  delete content. Archiving (`vault-log-archive`, `vault-project-status`)
  relocates content, never destroys it.
- **Review-gated by default.** The vault's normal flow is
  `logger → review → promote`, so RM's approval stays in the loop.
  `vault-review` only applies decisions RM states (it never approves on
  RM's behalf) and `vault-edit` bypasses the log only with a
  before → after confirmation, then records the change as a `[PROMOTED]`
  context entry so every direct edit is traceable.
- **Marker flips** (`[APPROVED]` → `[PROMOTED]`) use a schema-preserving
  two-line anchor pattern to prevent accidental field deletion during
  edits.
- **Module support**: projects can be nested one level deep
  (`projects/{parent}/{module}/`). The sync skill automatically includes
  parent OVERVIEW context for modules.
